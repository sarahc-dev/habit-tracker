# Habit Tracker App

This is an app to track your habits. You can check off your habits daily and see your progress. You can also edit and delete habits. I am currently working on visualising habit progress over the previous months and implementing weekly habits.

The app is [deployed on Vercel](https://habit-tracker-sarahc.vercel.app/). You can create an account or sign in with the following credentials to test it out:

```none
